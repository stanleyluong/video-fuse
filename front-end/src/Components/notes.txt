video again will remove it from playlist
clicking a new video will add it to the end of the playlist
optional: merge individual videos into one, use transloadit api to merge but encountered https error. for server side not client side. npm http2 deprecated. 
reduce to 8 videos, add redux or context, raise videoPlayer higher, implement encoding.com concatenation api, add ability to add a video twice in a row or more, add a row of the posters that disappear one at a time as videos are removed
instead of removing them from playlist, it continues to play next video if there is one. at the end of playlist it begins from the beginning
click picture on playlist to remove from playlist, pressing poster on videolist will add more to end of playlist instead of removing from playlist.
